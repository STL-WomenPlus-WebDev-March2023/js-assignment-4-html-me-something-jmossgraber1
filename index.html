         <h3>1. New York Style (the best one)</h3>
         <br><br>
         <img src="./IMAGES/NYStyle.jpeg">
         <br><br>
         <p>
         <h5>Characteristics:</h5> Thin crust that's pliable but crispy. Tomato sauce. Mozzarella. Perfection.<br>
         <h5>Brief origin story:</h5> Based on Neopolitan style pizza which was brought to NYC by Italian immigrants in early 20th century. Neopolitan style emerged about 400 years earlier when sailors brought tomatoes to Italy from South America. <br>
         <h5>My Thoughts:</h5>  Nothing better. <br><br>

            <h3>2. Detroit Style (the square one)<br><img src="./IMAGES/DetroitStyle.jpeg"> 
            </h3>
            <p>
            <h5>Characteristics:</h5> Wikipedia says it's a "deep-dish, rectangular pizza topped with Wisconsin brick cheese and a cooked tomato-based sauce."
            <h5>Brief Origin Story:</h5> Created by Buddy's Pizza in 1946. The square pans came from Detroit's auto industry. 
            <h5>My Thoughts:</h5>Intrigued by it's status as the culinary culimination of the industrial revolution. Love the foccacia-ness of it. <br><br>

            <h3>3. Chicago Style (the deep-dish one with sauce on top)<br><img src="./IMAGES/ChicagoStyle.jpeg"> 
            </h3>
            <p>
            <h5>Characteristics:</h5> Round, deep-dish pizza (like, three inches deep).
            <h5>Brief Origin Story:</h5> Created by the founders of Pizzeria Uno in 1943. They anticipated that American GI's who served in Italy would return home with a hankering for pizza.
            <h5>My Thoughts:</h5>This is delicious casserole. It is not pizza.<br><br>

            <h3>4. California Style (the one with weird toppings)<br><img src="./IMAGES/CaliStyle.jpeg"> 
            </h3>
            <p>
            <h5>Characteristics:</h5> Classic NY/Neopolitan-style crust with non-traditional toppings like avocado, goat cheese, or foie gras. 
            <h5>Brief Origin Story:</h5> Bay-area chefs Alice Waters and Ed LaDou are credited with creating the style in the early 1980's.
            <h5>My Thoughts:</h5>Ambivalent. I appreciate the creativity but also think if it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br><br>

            <h3>5. St. Louis Style (the one with Provel &reg)<br><img src="./IMAGES/STLStyle.jpeg">
            </h3>
            <p>
            <h5>Characteristics:</h5> A yeast-less, cracker-like crust topped with tomato sauce and Provel "cheese".
            <h5>Brief Origin Story:</h5> Professional singer Amedeo Fiore moved from Chicago to St. Louis and opened a pizza place near the Chase Park Plaza Hotel in the mid-1940's. Like Chicago and Detroit styles, the pizza's popularity was fueled by GI's returning from Italy.
